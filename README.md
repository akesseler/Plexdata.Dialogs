# Plexdata Dialogs

This library represents a collection of dialog windows especially designed to be used in other 
WFP projects.

For the moment, this library supports two dialog windows. The first one is a replacement of the 
standard Windows message box. The second one is a open folder dialog window allowing to easily 
choose a directory.

## Dialog Box

The _Dialog Box_ represents a simple replacement of the standard Windows message box. This dialog 
has been implemented because of the fact that in WPF the standard Windows message box looks pretty 
ugly.

## Open Folder Dialog

The _Open Folder Dialog_ instead represents a dialog window allowing users to choose a particular 
directory. This dialog has been implemented because of the fact that such a dialog box does not 
exist in WPF.
